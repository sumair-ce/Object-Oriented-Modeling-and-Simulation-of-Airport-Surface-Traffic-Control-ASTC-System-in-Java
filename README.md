# Object Oriented Modeling and Simulation of Airport Surface Traffic Control (ASTC) Using Java with GUI

What is actually in this project:
We have a system called ASTC that works like a team. In this system, different jobs get done
when different parts talk to each other. ASTC does different types of tasks, like when an airplane
wants to land. The airplane talks to a controller, and if it's okay to land, a message is sent, and
the landing starts. Doing tasks in ASTC happens in a specific order and time. Each part of the
team has its own way of doing its job. Tasks at an airport can be easy or hard, depending on what
the team is practicing. But for all situations, we need something called a 'task engine' to manage
the tasks.

Key features or project are:

• Implementation of File Handling techniques in Java
• Using Threads in Java
• Designing Graphical User Interface in Java
